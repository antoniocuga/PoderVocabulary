##Introduction
PoderVocabulary is a news-focused vocabulary for identifying and expressing relationships of power and influence of people, companies and organizations. PoderVocabulary is based on OWL (Web Ontology Language), Friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) and BIO, an extension of FOAF, focused on biographical information. Starting from those vocabularies, PoderVocabulary incorporates what we call "Connections," that is, relations between people, companies, organizations and news, with some context - adding several new classes and subclasses of connections. 

PoderVocabulary was originally created by Poderopedia (a project by Poderomedia Foundation with funding from the Knight News Challenge), that aims to promote greater transparency in Chile by mapping and visualizing the relationships among the country's elite. While it`s originally designed to be focus on Chilean political, civic and business leaders, PoderVocabulary can be used in other contexts with minor or no modifications at all.
